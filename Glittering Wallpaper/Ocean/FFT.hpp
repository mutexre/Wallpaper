FFTOcean is a C++ implementation of researcher J. Tessendorf's paper
"Simulating Ocean Water". It is a real-time simulation of ocean water
in a 3D world. The (reverse) FFT is used to compute the 2D wave height
field from the Philipps spectrum. It is possible to adjust parameters
such as wind speed, direction and strength, wave choppiness, and sea depth.

/*
This class defines the Cooley-Tukey algorithm for the Fourier Transform computation.
The data (time domain or spectrum) has to be stored in the real and imag vectors. Then
the direct FFT transform can be computed with a call to reverse(), and the reverse FFT
transform can be computed with a call to reverse(). The result is computed on-site, i.e.
in the vectors given to the FFT object. FFT computes the Fourier transform in O(nlog(n))
instead of O(n^2).
