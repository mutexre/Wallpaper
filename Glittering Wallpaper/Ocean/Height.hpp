FFTOcean is a C++ implementation of researcher J. Tessendorf's paper
"Simulating Ocean Water". It is a real-time simulation of ocean water
in a 3D world. The (reverse) FFT is used to compute the 2D wave height
field from the Philipps spectrum. It is possible to adjust parameters
such as wind speed, direction and strength, wave choppiness, and sea depth.

/*
This class computes the initial spectrum for the scene. Using random gaussian
numbers, it makes sure the ocean is different everytime the software is run.
This class needs the Philipps spectrum to run, and defines a fonctor to be used
with std::generate algorithm.
