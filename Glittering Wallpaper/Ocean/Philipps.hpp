FFTOcean is a C++ implementation of researcher J. Tessendorf's paper
"Simulating Ocean Water". It is a real-time simulation of ocean water
in a 3D world. The (reverse) FFT is used to compute the 2D wave height
field from the Philipps spectrum. It is possible to adjust parameters
such as wind speed, direction and strength, wave choppiness, and sea depth.

/*
This class implements the Philipps spectrum, a spectrum representative of the spectrum
of ocean waves. The spectrum can be obtained with the operator (). This choice makes it
available for use with std::generate algorithm. This spectrum contains the scene parameters,
as they have an impact of the waves shape, so on their spectrum too. Such parameters are
wind speed, wind force (how the waves align with the wind direction) and the minimum wave size.
